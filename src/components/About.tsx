                    <p className="text-lg">At Brother’s Restaurant, our story begins with two passionate brothers united by a common dream — to create a place where food feels like home. From our humble beginnings, we’ve grown into a warm, welcoming destination where the aroma of authentic Nepali spices meets heartfelt hospitality.

                        Built on a foundation of family values, teamwork, and respect for tradition, we work closely with our dedicated staff to ensure every guest feels like part of the family. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a regular, we believe in treating everyone with kindness, sincerity, and a full plate.

                        Our mission is simple: to serve real Nepali food made with real love. From momos and dal bhat to sel roti and gundruk, every dish is prepared using traditional techniques and fresh, locally sourced ingredients — just like back home.

                        We take pride in being more than just a restaurant. We’re a gathering place for the community, a reminder of home for Nepalis abroad, and an introduction to our culture for those eager to explore it.

                        So come in, take a seat, and enjoy the true taste of Nepal — served by brothers, prepared with care, and shared with joy.
